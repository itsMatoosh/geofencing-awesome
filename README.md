# Geofencing

A sample geofencing plugin with background execution support for Flutter.

## Getting Started
This plugin works on both Android and iOS. Follow the instructions in the following sections for the
platforms which are to be targeted.

### Android

No additional setup required.
 
### iOS

Add the following lines to your Info.plist:

```xml
<dict>
    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE</string>
    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE</string>
    ...
```

And request the correct permissions for geofencing:

```xml
<dict>
    ...
    <string>Main</string>
    <key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
    <array>
        <string>location-services</string>
        <string>gps</string>
        <string>armv7</string>
    </array>
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
        <string>location</string>
    </array>
    ...
</dict>
```

Add this line to `Runner-Briding-Header.h`

```h
#import <geofencing/GeofencingPlugin.h>
```

At the end add this line to `AppDelegate.swift`

```swift
GeofencingPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { (registry) in GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: registry) }
```

### Notes
Before register geofence request permissions for location and location always. You can use *permission_handler* package. Don't forget include this line in `Podfile`

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
        config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
          '$(inherited)',
          'PERMISSION_LOCATION=1',
        ]
      end
  end
end
```
